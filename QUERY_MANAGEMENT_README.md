## Navigation

- This will be visible for users with the 'user' role (EXCO users)

### For Finance Users
Finance users can create queries through the existing program management interface, but they don't have access to the Query Management view.

## API Endpoints

The system uses the following API endpoints:

1. **Get User Queries**: `GET /api/programs?action=getUserQueries&userId={userId}`
2. **Answer Query**: `POST /api/programs?action=answerQuery`
3. **Get Program Details**: `GET /api/programs?action=getProgram&id={programId}`

## Translation Support

The system supports both English and Malay languages through the LanguageContext:
- All UI text is translatable
- Language switching affects the entire Query Management interface
- New translation keys have been added for all features

## Usage Instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

3. **Program details not showing**: Ensure the program ID is valid

### Debug Information

- Ensure user has proper permissions for the 'user' role

## Integration Notes

The Query Management system integrates seamlessly with:
- **Existing Program Management**: Uses the same data structures
- **User Authentication**: Respects user roles and permissions
- **Language System**: Supports the existing translation framework
- **Error Boundary**: Protected by the application's error handling

This system provides EXCO users with a comprehensive tool to manage and respond to Finance queries efficiently, improving communication and program management workflow.
